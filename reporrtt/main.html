            <h3>1. Project "ज्ञान दीप" (Gyaan Deep) – Illuminating Education</h3>
            <p>In 2023, MUSKAAN FOUNDATION❤️ launched Project Gyaan Deep, an initiative aimed at bringing education to underprivileged children in rural areas. The project set up mobile learning centers, equipped with books, tablets, and educational tools, in remote villages where access to formal education was limited. Through these centers, children from marginalized communities received lessons in reading, writing, math, and science, along with basic computer skills. Local volunteers and teachers were recruited to ensure continuous learning, and periodic workshops were held to engage children in creative activities like painting, storytelling, and games. Over 500 children benefitted from this project, and many of them are now on track to enroll in formal schools.</p>

            <h3>2. Project "स्वास्थ्य से सुरक्षा" (Swasthya Se Suraksha) – Health for Safety</h3>
            <p>In 2022, MUSKAAN FOUNDATION❤️ introduced Project Swasthya Se Suraksha, focusing on improving the health and well-being of children in slum areas. Recognizing the lack of access to basic healthcare, the project organized monthly health camps, providing free medical check-ups, vaccinations, and nutritional supplements for children aged 5-12. Along with healthcare services, workshops on hygiene, nutrition, and disease prevention were conducted for both children and their families. By the end of the project, over 1,000 children had received medical care, and the community saw a significant improvement in overall child health and awareness of hygiene practices.</p>
